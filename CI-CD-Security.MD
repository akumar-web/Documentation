# 🔒 Secure Your CI/CD Pipeline (GitHub Actions + ArgoCD)

---

## ✅ 1. GitHub Repository Security

- [x] Use **private repositories**
- [x] Enable **branch protection rules**
- [x] Enable **code scanning** and **Dependabot alerts**
- [x] Use **signed commits**  
  ```bash
  git config --global commit.gpgsign true

## ✅ Step 2: Protect GitHub Secrets

- 🔒 **Store sensitive data securely:**
  Navigate to:  
  `GitHub → Repository → Settings → Secrets`

- 🚫 **Never hardcode credentials**  
  Avoid putting AWS keys, `kubeconfig`, tokens, or any secrets directly in your code or workflow files.

-  **Use Environment Secrets in GitHub Actions**  
  Reference secrets securely in your workflow:
  ```yaml
  env:
    AWS_ACCESS_KEY_ID: ${{ secrets.AWS_ACCESS_KEY_ID }}
    AWS_SECRET_ACCESS_KEY: ${{ secrets.AWS_SECRET_ACCESS_KEY }}
    KUBECONFIG_DATA: ${{ secrets.KUBECONFIG_DATA }}

## ✅ Step 3: Secure GitHub Actions Workflows

- 🔐 **Restrict permissions in `.github/workflows/*.yml`**

  Minimize the scope of GitHub token access using `permissions:` block in workflows:

  ```yaml
  permissions:
    contents: read
    id-token: write






# 🚀 ArgoCD Best Practices

---

### ✅ I created ArgoCD in its own namespace
> Helps isolate ArgoCD components from other workloads for better control and security.

---

### 🔐 I Enable RBAC policies to restrict user permissions
> Apply fine-grained access control to users and service accounts using Role-Based Access Control.

---

### 🌐 I use Git repositories over HTTPS with deploy keys, not SSH
> Prevents potential SSH key mismanagement and simplifies secret rotation.

---

### 🔍 I can enable Audit logs and SSO for access control
> Enable single sign-on (SSO) integration and keep audit logs for all changes for accountability and visibility.

---

### 🔁 Will Rotate tokens regularly and avoid storing plaintext secrets
> Regularly rotate access tokens and credentials. Never store sensitive data in unencrypted form.
