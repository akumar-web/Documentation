   ArgoCD Best Practices -:
 I created ArgoCD in its own namespace
Helps isolate ArgoCD components from other workloads for better control and security.

 I Enable RBAC policies to restrict user permissions
Apply fine-grained access control to users and service accounts using Role-Based Access Control.

 I use Git repositories over HTTPS with deploy keys, not SSH
Prevents potential SSH key mismanagement and simplifies secret rotation.

I can enable Audit logs and SSO for access control
Enable single sign-on (SSO) integration and keep audit logs for all changes for accountability and visibility.

 Will Rotate tokens regularly and avoid storing plaintext secrets
Regularly rotate access tokens and credentials. Never store sensitive data in unencrypted form.
